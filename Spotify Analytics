# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# I then created a table to insert the Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

#After creating the table in SQLite Studio, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

***How many individual artist are on the list?***

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT artist_name)AS unique_artist_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

*** Which artist have the most songs on the list and 
    how many songs do they have listed?***
    
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name)AS track_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(track_name) >=2
ORDER BY track_count DESC;

***What is the average danceability by artist?***

SELECT ROUND(AVG(danceability),4) AS avg_danceability, artist_name AS a_n
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY a_n
ORDER BY avg_danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;

***Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?***

SELECT artist_name, SUM(popularity) AS total_pop
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_pop DESC
LIMIT 10;

***What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?***

SELECT ROUND(AVG(danceability),4) AS avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity IN(SELECT MAX(popularity)
            FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
            ORDER BY MAX(popularity) DESC
            LIMIT 10);

***Which artists released the top 5 longest songs and what are their
   lengths in minutes?***

SELECT artist_name, track_name, ROUND(duration_ms/60000.00,2) AS duration_min
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER By duration_min DESC
LIMIT 5;
